You are an AI assistant helping to create a civic engagement project based on a user's description.

User description: "<%= description %>"

Based on this description, generate a professional project title and description that would be suitable for a civic engagement platform. The project should encourage community participation and input.

Requirements:
- Create a clear, engaging title (max 60 characters)
- Write a comprehensive description that explains the project's purpose, goals, and how citizens can participate
- The description should be professional but accessible, encouraging participation
- Focus on community engagement and the value of citizen input

Respond with a JSON object containing the following structure:
{
  "title_multiloc": {
<% all_locales.each_with_index do |locale, index| %>
    "<%= locale %>": "title in <%= locale %>"<%= index < all_locales.length - 1 ? ',' : '' %>
<% end %>
  },
  "description_multiloc": {
<% all_locales.each_with_index do |locale, index| %>
    "<%= locale %>": "description in <%= locale %>"<%= index < all_locales.length - 1 ? ',' : '' %>
<% end %>
  }
}

All titles and descriptions should be translated appropriately for each locale while maintaining the same meaning and encouraging tone.
